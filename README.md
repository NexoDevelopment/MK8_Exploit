# *hax - Mario Kart 8 primary userland exploit for the WiiU

Actual implementation (base ROP chain to ACE) of the [**exploit Kinnay**](https://github.com/Kinnay/Mario-Kart-8-Exploit) found in the WiiU version of Mario Kart 8. **Running this will boot the homebrew launcher.**

# Credits
 - [**Kinnay**](https://github.com/Kinnay/) for the NintendoClients library that allows use to communicate with NEX game servers and its protocols.
 - [**Maschell**](https://github.com/Maschell/) for working with me on this exploit (and being as addicted as i was doing this), there was **a lot** of co-operation
 - **Rambo6Glaz** / **NexoCube** / **TheBrick** for working on this, obviously.
 - [**wiiu-env**](https://github.com/wiiu-env/payload_loader) for the payload_loader that's inside ``payload0/main_hook.h``

# Requirements
- A WiiU
- Two NNIDs logged into your WiiU
- A computer logged on the same network than the console
 
# README, for real

- The exploit may not work on the first try (~85% success rate)
- Do not run any homebrew using memory before launching MK8 (like TCPGecko, Cafiine or Diibugger)

# How to use

1) Edit ``exploit.py`` and fill in your Nintendo Network IDs  + console informations
2) Edit ``main_exploit.py`` and edit the local computer IP
3) Run ``make`` to build the ``payload0`` binary (you need devkitPro + devkitPPC)
4) Go on your WiiU, log on the **victim** NNID
5) Open MK8, go online and host a private match, stay in the "earth menu", make sure you're alone in the room
6) Start ``stage0.py`` and press ENTER (leave it in the background), then start ``main_exploit.py`` and press ENTER
7) Wait for the game to reboot and rehost a private match, stay in the "earth menu", make sure you're alone in the room
8) Start ``stage1.py`` and press ENTER (leave it in the background), then start ``main_exploit.py`` and press ENTER
9) It should open the HOME Menu, return to the WiiU Menu, and tadaa, magic, **you're on the HBL**
